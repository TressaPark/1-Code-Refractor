This is Tressa Park's First Homework Submission

In the HTML file

I removed two div tags and replaced with nav tags.
I removed two unanecessary nav tags.
I changed <section class> to <main class>
I changed <section class> to <aside class>


In the CSS file

I made all of the coding match the new HTML code.
I simplified the .benefits, .benefit, .benefit h3, and .benefit img by removing repeated coding.
I simplified the main section, main section img, and main section h2 as above.
